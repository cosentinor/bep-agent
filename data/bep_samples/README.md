# BEP Sample Documents

This directory should contain sample BIM Execution Plan documents in DOCX format.

## Instructions

1. **Add Sample BEPs**: Place your existing BEP documents (.docx files) in this directory
2. **File Format**: Only DOCX files are currently supported
3. **File Naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., "Office_Building_BEP.docx", "Hospital_Project_BEP.docx")

## What Makes a Good Sample BEP

- **Complete Structure**: Documents with clear headings and sections
- **Diverse Project Types**: Different building types, sizes, and complexities
- **Standard Format**: Well-structured documents following BEP best practices
- **Recent Documents**: Up-to-date plans reflecting current BIM standards

## Typical BEP Sections

Good sample BEPs typically include sections like:

- Executive Summary
- Project Information
- Project Goals and BIM Objectives
- Organizational Roles and Responsibilities
- BIM Process Design
- BIM Information Exchanges
- BIM Deliverables
- Technology Infrastructure
- Model Quality Assurance
- Collaboration Procedures
- Model Management and File Naming
- Implementation Timeline
- Training Requirements

## Privacy Note

Ensure that any sample documents you add do not contain sensitive or confidential information. Consider using anonymized or template versions of your BEPs.

## Getting Started

If you don't have sample BEPs available:

1. Search for publicly available BEP templates online
2. Use BEP templates from industry organizations
3. Create simplified example documents based on BEP standards
4. Contact your organization's BIM team for suitable examples

The system will work better with more diverse and comprehensive sample documents.
